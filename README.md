# Iris_Dataset
The project uses logistic regression to classify flowers from the Iris dataset. It trains a model on flower features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The model then learns to predict which type of iris flower (e.g., Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) a flower belongs to.
